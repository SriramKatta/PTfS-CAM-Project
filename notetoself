i have already parallised few func CG and PCG are left 

all the parallel funcs are in diffrent branches need to merge all of them into a single branch and get the perf data 
look into merging into a new brach and not the main branch for now so that we can compare with non parallel version 

research on optimising CG and PCG solvers
